# snake
This is my attempt at making the game snake.
The aim of the game is to guide the snake around the grid, eating apples as they appear to pick up points, with each apple eaten the snake will grow and get faster. You must  avoid hitting the side, top and bottom walls, and avoid colliding with the snake itself, any of these will result in the game ending.
